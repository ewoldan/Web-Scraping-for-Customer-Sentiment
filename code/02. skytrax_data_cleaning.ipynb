    "Data Cleaning Checklist:\n",
    "- Remove Duplicates – Check for and drop duplicate rows.\n",
    "- Handle Missing Values – Identify NaN values and decide whether to fill them or drop the rows/columns.\n",
    "- Standardize Formats – Ensure dates, numbers, and strings are in a consistent format.\n",
    "- Trim Whitespaces – Clean up extra spaces in text fields.\n",
    "- Correct Data Types – Convert columns to their appropriate types (e.g., strings to dates, floats to integers).\n",
    "- Remove Special Characters – Especially in text or numerical fields that should be clean.\n",
    "- Check for Outliers – Identify extreme values that might be errors.\n",
    "- Normalize/Categorize Data – Standardize categorical values (e.g., \"NY\" vs. \"New York\").\n",
    "- Validate Data – Ensure values fall within expected ranges.\n",
    "- Check for Duplicated or Incorrect Entries in Key Columns – Especially if you have primary keys or important identifiers."
